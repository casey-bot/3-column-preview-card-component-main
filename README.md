## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Reflection

This challenge came a lot easier to me than some previous ones. I'm learning! Definitely feeling more confident with HTML and CSS, but want to get an even surer foothold before I start on JS, frameworks, etc.
